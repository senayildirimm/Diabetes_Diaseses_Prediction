# Diabetes_Diaseses_Prediction
** Business Problem: **  Developing a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. In this machine learning project, I will be using Machine Learning to make predictions on whether a person is suffering from Diabetes Disease or not.
