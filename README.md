# Diabetes_Diaseses_Prediction
**Business Problem:**  Developing a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. In this machine learning project, I will be using Machine Learning to make predictions on whether a person is suffering from Diabetes Disease or not.

**About Dataset**
* Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
* Glucose: Glucose
* BloodPressure: Blood pressure
* SkinThickness: Skin Thickness
* Insulin: Insulin
* BMI: Body mass index.
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that calculates our probability of having diabetes based on our ancestry
* Age: Age (years)
* Outcome: Information whether the person has diabetes or not. Have the disease (1) or not (0)

* The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.

**Project Tasks**
* Step I. Importing Essential Libraries
* Step II. Descrictive Statistic
* Step III. Data Visualization
* Step IV. Data Modeling
* a.) KNN ( K-Nearest Neighbors )
* b.) Logestic Regression
* c.) Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Step V. Model Evaluation
